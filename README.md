Poisson Distribution:

A poisson distribution with 1000 samples is generated randomly using numpy.random.poisson function of the numpy library. The function takes two parameters - expectation value (Î») for the distribution, and the number of samples to be generated, and returns an array containing the samples

Gaussian/Normal Distribution:

A gaussian/normal distribution with 1000 samples is generated randomly using numpy.random.normal function of the numpy library. The function takes three parameters - the mean of the distribution, the standard deviation (width) of the distribution and the number of samples to be generated, and returns an array containing the samples.
